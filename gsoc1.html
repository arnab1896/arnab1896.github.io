<p>Having recently participated in Google Summer of Code 2018 as a student and being a newcomer to the world of open source, it might seem a little intrepid of me to pen down an article about the stages of becoming a full fledged experienced open source developer. Nonetheless, here i am penning down this article which has resulted out of the experiences i’ve had in the Open Source community so far.
<br><br>

I would like to share a metaphor. Imagine a group of mountain climbers trying to get to the summit of a mountain.
<br><br>

There are some who are doing it for the first time - the <b>BEGINNERS</b>. They find it difficult to get used to this activity and its all new to them - from maintaining the rations like water and oxygen cylinders to getting used to the physical exhaustion and also the psychological factor - the will power and ability to keep going forward despite setbacks is important.
<br><br>

Then there’s another group who’ve already done this before a few times. They are definitely more confident but not so good that they can lead the expedition to the top. They know how to maintain the rations like water and oxygen upto the correct levels because they have experienced it a few times before already. Willpower is also a little stronger than the beginners. These are the <b>INTERMEDIATE</b> climbers.
<br><br>

Finally, the group leading the expedition - the <b>EXPERIENCED</b> - they have done mountain climbing dozens of times before. They lead the entire movement - from allocating resources and rations to the others to deciding course of action in case of disaster. The remaining group looks upto them for directions when they are stuck. The rest of the group draws inspiration from them too, because they are the leaders of the movement. The EXPERIENCED have already been successful at the act of mountain climbing and learned from their failures - but they still keep doing it and training the others to reach higher and better positions.

I’m sure, by now, you might have guessed what parallel i’m going to draw with the world of open source. I believe there are 3 distinct classes of developers in open source :-
<br><br>

<b>1. Beginner -</b> Struggle with basic concepts like version control systems. Also diving deep into the code base of an established open source organization seems difficult at first. Learning curve is steepest but once the initial effort is made, steadily progress is seen.
<br><br>

<b>2. Intermediate -</b> No struggle with basic issues like using GIT or some version control system. Familiarity with the code base is a plus point. However, time management becomes important because along with basic contributions to code base, other work like collaborating with team and community bonding becomes important.
<br><br>

<b>3. Experienced -</b> The leaders of the organization who decide the overall strategy for the organization and allocate new comers to issues that they will fit with perfectly. Conflict resolution(if any) and making sure that the machinery of the organization is well-oiled. Technically strong in coding with a firm grip on domain based knowledge makes them natural leaders.
<br><br>

I believe after my GSoC journey, I have almost reached the end of the first 'BEGINNERS' phase. It was a learning filled rewarding experience. Initial weeks were tough to get used to because coding was one of many things i was simultaneously juggling - blog progress, mentor calls, community bonding, documentation, research and learning about embryogenesis and neuroscience. 
<br><br>

Looking back, I couldn’t have pictured completing GSoC 2018 with a neuroscience domain organization, but the massive support that I received from the larger <a href="http://openworm.org/">OpenWorm Foundation</a> community, <a href="http://openworm.org/people.html">Stephen Larson and especially my mentor - Dr. Bradly Alicea</a> from <a href="https://devoworm.weebly.com/">DevoWorm</a> was instrumental in whatever I have been able to achieve this summer. I learned from them that dozens of  contributors sitting in 10 different time zones can collaborate to work on a project that has the potential to impact an entire community of researchers and developers.
<br><br>

<br><br>

<font size = "6" ><b>CONCLUSION - Aiming for a moonshot project</b></font>
<br><br>

I hope i can keep dedicating myself, if not fully, at least part-time to the cause of OpenWorm which if I may say is - “Building the world’s first worm-matrix, one line of code at a time”. The project that I worked on has given me a good foothold and introduction to the world of open source - especially the OpenWorm and DevoWorm foundation. Now, there’s no turning back. I have decided that <b><i>I will contribute to the cause of DevoWorm and drive it towards its successful integration with Geppetto</b></i>. Technically, its a moonshot project and will not be easy to achieve but HEY! I just participated in GOOGLE SUMMER OF CODE and doesn’t Google always say - aim for moonshots, its easier to make something 10X better than 10% better, so that’s what I’ll aim for - a moonshot. <b>Let’s see where it takes us - me and DevoWorm foundation. Worst case, we end up learning something amazing, best case - well, we integrate DevoWorm with Geppetto!</b>
<br><br>

Until we meet again!<br>
